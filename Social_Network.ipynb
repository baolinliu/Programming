    "# Background\n",
    "# ==========\n",
    "# You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming\n",
    "# social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know \n",
    "# what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is \n",
    "# up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information \n",
    "# and to define several procedures that operate on the network. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the \n",
    "# information comes in a big string of text. Each pair of sentences in the text \n",
    "# is formatted as follows: \n",
    "# \n",
    "# <user> is connected to <user1>, ..., <userM>.<user> likes to play <game1>, ..., <gameN>.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# For example:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# John is connected to Bryant, Debra, Walter.John likes to play The Movie: The Game, The Legend of Corgi, Dinosaur Diner.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Note that each sentence will be separated from the next by only a period. There will \n",
    "# not be whitespace or new lines between sentences.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Your friend records the information in that string based on user activity on \n",
    "# the website and gives it to you to manage. You can think of every pair of\n",
    "# sentences as defining a user's profile.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Consider the data structures that we have used in class - lists, dictionaries,\n",
    "# and combinations of the two (e.g. lists of dictionaries). Pick one that\n",
    "# will allow you to manage the data above and implement the procedures below. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# You may assume that <user> is a unique identifier for a user. For example, there\n",
    "# can be at most one 'John' in the network. Furthermore, connections are not \n",
    "# symmetric - if 'Bob' is connected to 'Alice', it does not mean that 'Alice' is\n",
    "# connected to 'Bob'.\n",
