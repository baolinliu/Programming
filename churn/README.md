Dear Students, 

To make sure we hit the ground running, here a quick summary of the Final Project deadline and instructions:

Submit your Churn model (only notebook) via email (nir@galvanize.com). 
Deadline: 7/1 by 11:59pm. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 
There will be two presentation sessions:
Presentation for a technical audience TBA
Presentation for a non-technical audience TBA 

Instructions for presentation:

You will have 8-10 minutes each to present your churn model. This presentation will be peer-reviewed by your classmates (we will provide a form).

We ask you to thoroughly prepare for your assigned presentation but also to think clearly of how you would prepare the alternative one. You don't need to submit your presentation slides until after the presentation.

Peer-review instructions:

We will provide a link to a form to provide written unbiased feedback on the merits of your colleagues' presentations together with a rationale of your opinion. You need to indicate whether the presentation is clear, concise, and relevant and rate the workâ€™s composition, accuracy, originality, and interest to the audience.

Your feedback will partially determine your colleagues' grade for the Churn Model Presentation part and also affect your own overall grade. We expect you to pay close attention to the presentations and provide constructive feedback and add value.
